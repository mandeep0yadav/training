We also need to have a list of the requested accounts in the RTF-New-Users.xls spreadsheet before we can process the account request. Here are the full instructions for requesting RTF accounts: 

I have attached the forms that you need to request accounts on our remote training facility (RTF). 

To request a batch of accounts, please do the following: 
1. Each person who is requesting an account should fill out & sign the attached individual acknowledgement form (C14-197). When filling out the form, they should be careful to use their company email address (@capgemini.com) and to write the correct employer (Cap Gemini). Otherwise, we cannot accept the form. They should scan the form as an image, and send the image to you. Each form should be saved in a separate file; please do not collect multiple forms into the same file. 

2. Once you have collected the scanned form images, please fill out the attached spreadsheet (RTF-New-Users.xls) with the contact information for each person who is requesting an account. The information in the spreadsheet must match the acknowledgement forms exactly; otherwise we cannot process the request.
